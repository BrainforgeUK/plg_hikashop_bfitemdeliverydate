For the emails you need to get rid of the Raw data display.
See Hikashop admin system / emails.

The related files have names like media/com_hikashop/mail/...html.modified.php
It is often easier to edit the files directly rather than use the admin screens.

See the following emails:
  ORDER_ADMIN NOTIFICATION
  ORDER CREATION NOTIFICATION
  ORDER STATUS NOTIFICATION

Look for line:
  if(empty($item->$namekey)) continue;

Add the following lines after it:
  // Start Added BRAINFORGE 12 Sept 2012
  if ($namekey == 'item_delivery_date' && class_exists('plgHikashopBFItemDeliveryDate')) continue;
  // End Added BRAINFORGE 12 Sept 2012

Changes to the text version of the emails may not be necessary, but check just in case.
Check for impact with any other email customisations.
